# Data-cleaning-of-Fifa-21
Clean and crisp database for the players available on FIFA 21. 
The FIFA 2021 dataset was originally gotten from Kaggle and can be accessed here. The dataset contains information about 18,979 football players and 77 columns of the players statistics and demography in 2021. The columns include the players Unique-ID, Name, Age, Nationality, Position, Overall Rating, Wage, Contract and so on. The dataset also has a data dictionary in order to be familiarized with the data before cleaning.
DATA CLEANING APPROACH:
Data Extraction: The raw dataset was originally downloaded as a Zipped file which was extracted and changed to CSV (Comma Separated Values) format which was then loaded into Microsoft Excel. The Screenshot below shows the raw dataset when loaded into Excel.
The data was reviewed in order to gain a better understanding of the dataset and during this process I noticed most of the records in the Name, Long Name, Club, Value, and Wage column have some non-printable characters and datatypes and some records contain null values as well.
